      <p class="body1"><em>Lutes</em> belong to the oldest plucked instruments. 
        Lute-like instruments have been found in archeological remains in the 
        Middle East and the Far East from as long as 4000 years ago. <br>
        In Europe<em> lutes</em> were the most popular instruments for a few hundred 
        years, especially from 1400 to 1800. This can be seen from the large volume 
        of books and manuscripts from that period. <br>
          The<em> lute</em> (both the instrument and the name) derives from the 
          Arabian<em> lute</em>, the <em>Ud</em> (&quot;<em>El Ud</em>&quot; - 
          or <em>Oud</em>), which is still much played (see <a href="middle_east.html"><font color="#408080">Middle 
          East</font></a><font color="#000000">)</font>. The instrument probably 
          reached West Europe from the Middle East via the Moors in Spain, or 
          was brought home by the Crusadors.<br>
        <br>
          Music for it was always written in tablature - a way of music notation 
          specially for plucked stringed lute-like instruments, where not the 
          pitch is notated, but which string on which fret has to be plucked. 
          Several different systems were in use (Spanish, French, Italian and 
          the most complicated : German), but all on the same basis : string + 
          fret. </p>
        <p class="body1">The <em>lute</em> era ended around 1750, when music (especially 
          Bach's) became too complicated to be played by non-professionals on 
          the <em>lute</em>, and was played more easily on keyboard instruments, 
          like the then popular <em>harpsichord</em> and <em>pianoforte</em>.</p>
      <p class="body1">The number of strings on a <em>lute</em> slowly increased 
        from about four courses on early <em>medieval lutes</em> to <em>theorbe 
        lutes</em> with many extra bass strings, fitted to extra long necks, reaching 
        finally a total of 14 (double) courses, or 26 strings in total.</font> 
        Since the Middle Ages there were always double strings in a course.</p>
        <p class="body1">For some other early medieval instruments, see <a href="mandolins.html"><font color="#408080">mandolins</font></a>

              <p class="body1">In many old paintings and statues in churches we 
                can find depictions of the <em>medieval lute</em>. This<em> lute</em> 
                is quite small and usually has 4 double courses. <br>
                <br>
                Sometimes this <em>early medieval lute</em> is confused with the 
                <em>gittern</em> (see <em><a href="mandolins.html"><font color="#408080">mandolins</font></a></em>), 
                which has a similar shape. The difference is usually the pegbox 
                : angled back on a <em>lute</em>, and a sickel-shape with scroll 
                on a <em>gittern</em>. In fact (more difficult to spot) the <em>lute</em> 
                body was made from separate ribs, glued together, while the<em> 
                gittern</em> was carved from one block of wood.<br>
                <br>
                The fingerboard of the <em>lute</em> was made of a strip of separate 
                wood, and flush with the soundboard. The frets were made of gut, 
                tied around the neck.<br>
                A nice decorated rosette seemed carved into the soundboard. On 
                some paintings a second rosette can be seen more towards the fingerboard 
                and some inlay decoration on the front. The strings were tied 
                to the bridge, which was glued to the soundboard. </p>
              <p class="body1">This<em> lute</em> could be played with a plectrum 
                (often a long one, like for the <em>oud</em>), or with the fingers. 
                The <em>gittern</em> was always played with a plectrum.</p></td>

              <p class="body1">There is no surviving <em>medieval lute</em>, but 
                there exists a scale drawing by Arnout van Zwolle from around 
                1450.</p>
              <p class="body1">The body of the <em>medieval lute</em> was usually 
                quite rounded. It was made of quite thin strips of (sycamore) 
                wood (the ribs), glued together (on a mould) in a half &quot;ball&quot;. 
                Glueing-on the soundboard gave the body its strength. <br>
                <br>
                The neck was made from a separate piece of wood and glued to the 
                body. The friction pegs were inserted from both sides to the peghead, 
                which was fixed at an almost straight angle to the neck. The fingerboard 
                was flush with the soundboard. In the soundboard a delicate rosette 
                (with usually an arabic pattern) was carved for the soundhole. 
              </p>
              <p class="body1">The gut strings were fixed to the bridge, which 
                was glued to the soundboard. The<em> medieval lute</em> often 
                had 5 (or later 6) courses of which the first string was single, 
                the rest double (with no octaves). Tuning would be GG cc ff aa 
                d'd' g'g'.</p>

              <p class="body1">In 16th century Spain the main plucked instrument 
                was the <em>vihuela</em>; also called <em>vihuela de mano</em> 
                or <em>viola a mano </em>(in Italy). Tuned and played like the 
                <em>lute</em> (which was popular in the rest of Europe), the shape 
                of the <em>vihuela</em> was like a (slender) <em>guitar</em>. 
                It is not known why the Spanish prefered this body shape to the<em> 
                lute</em>, but probably it had to do with the <em>lute</em> reminding 
                them too much of the <em>oud</em> of the Moors. <br>
                It seems that only two <em>vihuelas</em> survived (both now in 
                Paris' museums), but one is rather large and seems more like a 
                woodworkers exam piece. A church in Quito (Ecuador) has a guitar-like 
                instrument, which is also believed to be a <em>vihuela</em>. </p>
              <p class="body1">The body of the <em>vihuela</em> was made like 
                a <em>guitar</em>, but with only a few bars under the soundboard 
                (like the <em>lute</em>). On the existing pictures there are usually 
                some inlay squares on the front, and a (parchment inlay) rosette 
                in the soundhole (some had more soundholes). The fingerboard is 
                flush with the top, and the frets are tied-on gut string. The 
                friction pegs are inserted from the back of the rather straight 
                tuning head. The strings are tied to the bridge, which is glued 
                to the soundboard.</p>
              <p class="body1">There are about 7 rather large volumes of music 
                written especially for the <em>vihuela</em>, all from Spain and 
                from the period around 1550. All are written in tablature - a 
                kind of music notation, especially for stringed instruments. The 
                number of courses indicated in the tablature is 4 to 9. This music 
                is of quite high musical standard, often using multiple voices. 
                As the tuning of the <em>vihuela</em> is the same as a normal 
                <em>renaissance lute</em>, the music of both can be played on 
                it. For the 4-course <em>renaissance guitar</em> (from the same 
                period but regarded as a totally different instrument) see under

        <p class="body1">After the Middle Ages the <em>lute</em> slowly changed 
          from a rounded to an elongated body shape. The number of ribs was from 
          about 7 to 11. The rosette was always carved in the soundboard. </p>
        <p class="body1"> The fingerboard was made of dark wood (often ebony), 
          and flush with the soundboard. The friction pegs were placed on both 
          sides of the open peghead, which was bent back to an almost straight 
          angle. The frets were pieces of gut string, tied around the neck. The 
          top frets were of wood and glued on the soundboard. The strings were 
          tied to the bridge, which was glued on the soundboard.</p>
        <p class="body1">The number of (gut) strings increased : from 5 to 6, 
          7, and finally up to 10 double courses. <br>
          All strings were on one neck, and could all be fingered, resulting in 
          a quite wide fingerboard. <br>
          The tuning of the top 6 strings was almost like a <em>guitar</em>, but 
          with an extra, higher tuned string (5-5-4-5-5) : G c f a d' g' .<br>
          The lower (extra) strings (courses) were in fact basses (called &quot;diapasons&quot;) 
          which were only played open, and tuned to the particular piece of music 
          to play. The top double courses were in unison, but the diapasons were 
          in octaves. Lutes were made in different sizes to get higher or lower 
          pitches, to accomodate the singers' voice, and known as for instance 
          F or G lutes (after the top string), or as &quot;treble&quot; (c or 
          d), &quot;tenor&quot; (f, g or a) or &quot;bass&quot; lutes (C or D).</p>
        <p class="body1">There exists an enormous repertoire of<em> lute</em> 
          music, often found in manuscripts of various players (both professionals 
          and amateurs) and it is amazing to find that also in those early centuries 
          some pieces became tophits and travelled quite fast around Europe - 
          even without the use of modern radio or CD's !</p></td>

      <td valign="top" bgcolor="#E9E9E9" height="596"><p class="name1"><strong>orpharion</strong></p>
        <p class="body1">The orpharion is a delicate instrument, which seems like 
          a combination of a <em>cittern</em> and a <em>lute</em>: the tuning 
          of the <em>lute</em> and the metal (&quot;wire&quot;) strings of the 
          <em>cittern</em>. In fact it is a later version (and about 3/4 size) 
          of a <em>bandora </em>(see under). Only two original instruments survived 
          : the Palmer <em>orpharion</em> (in Copenhagen) and the Rose <em>orpharion</em> 
          (in UK). It was designed in the second half of the 16th century.</p>
        <p class="body1">The <em>orpharion</em> was made like a <em>guitar</em>, 
          with a flat or slightly rounded back, and with a beautiful wavy outline 
          (which fits in the outline of a <em>renaissance lute</em>). The rosette 
          was carved in the soundboard (like the<em> lute</em>) or made of separate 
          wood and inserted.<br>
          <br>
          The fingerboard is slightly higher than the soundboard. The back of 
          the neck is not over the full width, but only on the right (lower) side 
          : the fingerboard sticks out on the bass side, so forming a kind of 
          d-shape (a similar neck is found on the <em>cittern</em>). The frets 
          are pieces of brass, set in the fingerboard. The pegbox is slightly 
          curved and ends in a curl to the front - either with a square or with 
          a carved head, like on the <em>cittern</em>.<br>
          <br>
          The strings are made of metal and brass (the basses are twisted), usually 
          in 6 to 9 double courses. They are fixed to the bridge with hitch-pins. 
          The most interesting thing of the <em>orpharion</em> is the fact that 
          the stringlength of the trebles is shorter than that of the basses. 
          This results in the nut, frets and bridge being placed at an angle, 
          demanding quite some accuracy from the instrument builder.<br>
          The fretboard is a bit scalloped : the wood between the frets is lower 
          than next to the frets. The frets were usually fixed in the sawcut with 
          wooden wedges.<br>
          <br>
          The tuning was the same as for the <em>renaisance lute</em>, so often 
          on music books was written : &quot;For Lute or Orpharion&quot;.</p>
        <p class="body1"> The thin metal strings produce a very &quot;singing&quot; 
          sound, and although every piece for <em>lute</em> can be played on the 
          <em>orpharion</em>, it is most satisfying to play <em>vihuela</em> music 
          on it, of which the separate voices stand out much more clearly than 
          on the short sounding gut/nylon strings. </p>

          : anything with some wavy outline seems to have been alright, but most 
          examples show that the bottom has one large curve, ending on both sides

          lute</em> became more popular there was a demand to get a better volume 
          from the basses. Thick gut strings tended to be dull sounding. The first 
          trick was to use the thickest strings available, but with a higher octave 
          string in the same course. Next was to increase the scale length. So 
          you see first the development of stepwise longer bass strings - for 
          each extra pitch a slightly longer scale. <br>
          The next development was to make an extra pegbox and start again with 
          the less thicker strings up to the thickest. Old <em>lutes</em> were 
          rebuilt to fit extra strings on additions to the pegbox (&quot;double 
          headed lutes&quot;, and &quot;(bass) riders&quot;), often with much 
          increased string lengths. All these instruments were in general called 
          <em>theorbes</em> (or similar in different languages), or <em>arch lutes</em>. 
          </font></p>
        <p class="body1"><font color="#408080">The body often became much bigger 
          than the original slender <em>renaissance lute</em>, but the tuning 
          was still the same (for the first 6 fretted strings, plus the unfretted 
          basses). However, because of the larger body size, the first (single 
          string) course could not be tuned high enough without breaking, and 
          so was often tuned an octave lower, as was sometimes even the second

        <p class="body1">To get really a strong bass sound, the neck of a bass 
          lute was sometimes extended to about double the stringlength for the 
          basses. <br>
          <br>
          The first pegbox does not bend back (like on a <em>renaissance lute</em>), 
          but goes straight up, while the second pegbox (in a complicated way) 
          bends back to the front. All the bass strings run from a single nut 
          and could not be played on the fingerboard. Usually the first 7 (unison) 
          courses could be fretted and were on the lower tuning head. The name 
          for this long neck <em>lute</em> varies : besides the name <em>chitarrone, 
          </em>also<em> theorbe</em> or <em>tiorba</em> can be found.</p>
        <p class="body1">The <em>chitarrone</em> often had extra decoration and 
          even having 3 rosettes on the very large bodies was common.</p>
        <p class="body1">It was still in &quot;renaissance tuning&quot;, although 
          the first string was tuned down an octave. On some instruments the gut 
          strings were replaced by wire strings and sometimes even in single string 
          courses.</p>
        <p class="body1">The <em>chitarrone</em> was used in orchestras (e.g. 
          Mozart) and played &quot;basso continuo&quot; from &quot;figured bass&quot; 
          (chords) - the lute player had to swing the neck in the rhythm of the 
          music, to beat the time for the other musicians. </p>
        <p class="body1">A <em>chitarrone</em> has a stringlength of 760-1000mm 
          for the petit jeu (fingered strings) and 1550-1700mm for the basses. 
          A smaller <em>chitarrone</em> would be called an <strong>archlute</strong>, 
          with a petit jeu of 640-670mm and 1300 - 1450mm for the basses.</p></td>

          was designed at the end of the 16th century (probably by Piccinini) 
          and mainly used for solo music written by Italian composers up to the 
          end of the 17th century. So this particular model is called <em>liuto 
          attiorbato</em>, after the Italian translation of &quot;<em>theorbe 
          lute</em>&quot;.<br>
          <br>
          In this model of a <em>liuto attiorbato</em> the first pegbox does not 
          bend back (like a renaissance lute), but goes straight up, while the 
          second pegbox bends (in a complicated way) back to the front. That pegbox 
          has a single nut, from which 7 bass courses run, which are passing the 
          fingerboard too high to be able to be fingered. The first 7 (unison) 
          courses run from the normal tuning head and can be fingered. The 7 bass 
          courses are in octaves (sometimes not).<br>
          Tuning usually is : F'F G'G A'A B'B Cc Dd Ee / FF GG cc ff aa d'd' g'</p>
        <p class="body1">This model of <em>theorbe lute</em> was often used by 
          quite wealthy people and therefore most of the surviving instruments 
          are highly decorated : with etched ivory plates inlayed in the fingerboard 
          and sometimes the back of the body was completely made of ivory and/or 
          ebony. </p>

        <p class="body1">In Poland and Ukraine the idea of open strings was taken 
          even further than the <em>angelique</em>. Apparently they used a <em>theorbe 
          lute</em> (usually like a French <em>theorbe</em> or with a German swan-neck) 
          and put additional strings on the soundboard, similar to the strings 
          on their native <em>bandura</em> - the <em>zither</em> instrument which 
          was very popular in the Ukraine. The <em>torban</em> was used from the 
          17th century untill the early 19th century.</p>
        <p class="body1">The <em>torban</em> would be played by plucking the open 
          strings like on the <em>bandura</em> - the melody plucked on the short 
          strings and the basses on the long strings on the neck. Apparently the 
          strings on the neck were sometimes fingered.<br>
          Sometimes the name <em>torban</em> was used for the <em>theorbe lute</em> 
          (so for the fretted version, without additional strings).</p>
        <p class="body1"> The <em>torban</em> has since long disappeared, save 
          for a few historical reconstructions (see example).</p>
        <p class="body1">Being a kind of zither/harp the <em>torban</em> should

          <br>
          The <em>baroque lute</em> differed from the <em>renaissance lute</em> 
          mainly in the tuning : no more a guitar-like tuning, but (after lots 
          of experimenting, especially in France) an open d-minor on the top 6 
          courses : AA dd ff aa d'd' f'f'. <br>
          The lower basses were tuned in pitches that were depending on the particular

          20 strings. </p>

          century (when they discovered a way to make overspun gut strings) the 
          normal size<em> lute</em> (without the extra long neck) was also made 
          with 13 courses. Because the (bend back) peghead would have to be very 
          long to accomodate so many strings, often an older lute body was used 
          with the angled-back peghead, but with the tuning-head extented by &quot;riders&quot; 
          on both sides to accomodate the extra strings, without having to completely 
          replace the neck. Some riders had small bridges with for each bass string 
          a slightly longer string length, so the same thickness string could 
          be used for all basses.<br>
          <br>
          Often also the first (single) string was fixed on a kind of rider - 
          an extension on the treble side of the tuning head, only for the first 
          string.<br>
          <br>
          This type of neck was known as the <em>french theorbe</em> or <em>french 
          baroque lute, or double headed lute</em>. <br>
          <br>
          Although this type can be found in many (Dutch) paintings of the 18th 
          century, no such instrument has survived. The body is quite large, but 
          still has all the features of the original <em>renaissance lute</em>. 
          Some have a parchment lace around the edge of the body for protection.</p>
        <p class="body1">Music for the <em>baroque lute</em> became quite complicated, 
          but was very popular, with many players/composers. Some French lute 
          players (like Visee) also played the <em>baroque guitar. </em></p>
        <p class="exmpl"><br>
          On my example <em>lute</em> there are 3 rosettes - this was not usual 
          on <em>baroque lutes</em>, but was more often found on a <em>chitarrone</em>.

        <p class="body1">The <em>gallichone </em>(or <em>gallichon</em> or <em> 
          callichon </em>or<em> calichon </em>or<em> galizona </em>or<em> colachon 
          </em>or<em> mandora</em>) is a kind of bass-lute which was popular during 
          the 18th century in Germany and Italy, at the end of the era of the 
          <em>German Baroque lutes</em>. Only very few have survived.<br>
          <br>
          The <em>gallichone</em> looks very much like a large <em>baroque lute</em>, 
          but with a much longer neck. The peghead does not bend backwards like 
          on a normal <em>lute</em>, but makes a curl to the front.</p>
        <p class="body1">The <em>gallichones</em> were often used for continuo 
          playing, although there is an extensive solo repertoire. There are several 
          18th Century drawings showing lutenists playing these instruments, the 
          larger versions of which (with their typically powerful, clear bass 
          tone) made excellent continuo instruments.</p>
        <p class="body1">The tuning of the 6 (sometimes 7) gut courses was similar 
          to the <em>guitar</em>. </p>
        <p class="body1">Note that in the same period a type of <em>mandoline</em> 
          was used, with the same name.</p>

      lute </strong></span> <p class="body1">The <em>Swedish lute </em>(locally 
          known as <em>Svenska lutan</em>) is in fact a mixture of a <em>cittern</em> 
          and a <em>lute</em>, with some influence from the <em>English guitar</em>. 
          It was developed mainly by Mathias Kraft from Stockholm, in the second 
          half of the 18th century. Production stopped around 1820, but there 
          is a recent revival of the instrument.</p>
        <p class="body1">The <em>Swedish lute</em> is a kind of theorbed <em>cittern</em>, 
          but with lute-like features : like gut strings, and the strings fixed 
          to a bridge glued to the front (and not running to pins at the end of 
          the body). The back of the body was usually slightly curved. It has 
          metal frets. The strings however were single (not double like on a<em> 
          lute</em>). Eight of the strings ran over the fingerboard, and 7 came 
          from the bass attachment.</p>

          a b c#' d' e' a' c#&quot; e&quot;. <br>
          So only the first 4 strings were really played (in chords), all the 
          others followed the diatonic scale.<br>
          <br>
          The modern version looks more like a harp-guitar, with 6 strings on 
          the fingerboard, and 6 bass-strings on the side of it. It may uses steel 
          strings in guitar-tuning, or nylon strings in renaissance-lute-tuning. 
          It does not have the pitch raising device. </p>

        <p class="body1">In Germany in the 1920's people started singing old folk 
          songs and accompanied themselves on their <em>guitar</em>. But they 
          felt that a <em>lute</em> would be more appropriate for this &quot;old&quot; 
          music<em>,</em> so the <em>guitar lute</em> was introduced. <br>
          Made to look like the old<em> renaissance lute</em> (with 10-15 thin 
          separate ribs glued together for the body), but with a normal shape 
          guitar-neck and 6 proper (gut) guitar strings. The fretboard is flush 
          with the soundboard.<br>
          <br>
          The bridge was often modelled on the <em>baroque guitar</em> (with some 
          kind of &quot;mustache&quot; on both sides) but the strings are fastened 
          with bridge pins. The soundhole has a rosette, carved in the wood (like 
          on the older lutes), or a separate piece of wood inserted in the soundhole. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The frets are normal metal guitar-style frets, with some made of wood 
          on the soundboard. Friction pegs are not used : just tuning machines 
          (2x 3). The peghead ends in a square scroll, like on the <em>waldzittern</em>, 
          but sometimes the top gets a more delicately carved head.</p>
